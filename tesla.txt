Tesla, Inc. is an American electric vehicle (EV) and clean energy company founded in 2003 by a group of engineers, with Elon Musk later becoming its most prominent figure and CEO. Headquartered in Palo Alto, California (now Austin, Texas), Tesla aims to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. The company gained attention early on with the launch of the Tesla Roadster in 2008 — one of the first fully electric sports cars. Since then, it has developed a wide range of EVs, including the Model S, Model 3, Model X, and Model Y, each contributing to its rise as a global leader in electric mobility.

Tesla’s influence extends beyond electric vehicles. It has heavily invested in renewable energy solutions through products like Powerwall (home battery storage), Powerpack, and Megapack (for utility-scale energy), as well as solar panels and the Solar Roof. The company’s energy division, Tesla Energy, supports its mission of creating a sustainable energy ecosystem, where homes and businesses can generate, store, and use clean power efficiently.

One of Tesla’s biggest innovations lies in its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology — advanced driver-assistance systems that aim to eventually enable full autonomous driving. Tesla collects real-world driving data from its millions of cars to continuously improve these systems. The company is also working on projects like the Tesla Bot (Optimus), a humanoid robot, and has entered the heavy vehicle market with the Tesla Semi, targeting zero-emission freight transportation.

Tesla remains a polarizing but undeniably transformative force in modern technology and automotive sectors. It faces intense competition and scrutiny, but its rapid innovation, direct-to-consumer sales model, and massive Gigafactories have reshaped how cars are made and sold. With its expanding global footprint and continued push for sustainability, Tesla continues to play a central role in the world’s shift toward cleaner and smarter technologies.
